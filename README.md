## Project Structure

This project uses a modular architecture to separate functionality into smaller, reusable components. The main application resides in the `/app` directory, while local packages are in `/packages` for better code organization.

---


## Scripts

Here are some useful npm scripts:

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the application for production.


---

## Deployment

Deployment pipelines are managed using GitHub Actions. Each commit to the `main` branch triggers an automated build and deployment process. Ensure proper configuration of secrets (e.g., API keys) in the repository settings.
